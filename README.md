# Discord-RPC-Creator
This program is designed for those who are too lazy to download add-ons for Discord "CustomRPC"
You can create the same simply by downloading Vencord and in plugins find CustomRPC
If you have bugs write in Issues I will fix them. I am the first who made such a program.

To have your own RPC header you need to enter in the application name a header like here![image](https://github.com/misha27317/Discord-RPC-Creator/assets/126237284/1c17e3c7-79f2-46fe-8d7c-6fc5afe5fd7b)
